          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a student enrolled in UCF's Coding Bootcamp. I am having a great
            time learning about coding and putting it into practice. So far I have
            gotten to practice with three different programming languages and I
            hope to be able to master all three. I am interested in video game
            development and creating 2d pixel art for my games. I am currently
            working on a space-shooter game with all art assests that I personally
            drew.
          </p>
          <p>
            The three languages we have worked with so far is HTML, CSS, and
            Javascript! HTML and CSS have been pretty simple to understand and I
            was even able to make this very website within a couple of days! This
            website has been created with the help of Bootstrap framework, along
            with my personal styling.
